# Student Information Management System
## Overview
Student Information Management System (SIMS) is a fully computerized system or a database where all the student related data can be stored, retrieved, monitored & analysed. The data is saved at a centralized location & role-based login access is given to all the users for ensuring student data security.
Our 'Student Information Management System' aids in managing, storing, data such as admission number, tracking attendance, exam & test marks, notice board, teacher info, subject info and other student related data. The system gives both the student and teacher an overall view of the ongoing academic activities.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Students form the main part of any institution that concerns with. But the institution finds it difficult to keep the details of all the students. Thus, it involves a lot of paper work. Sometimes there will be huge heap of files bundled up and must be stored in some corner of the office.
Managing student records manually is a troublesome job, this increases as the number of students increases. This method may lead to missing or destroying important information and is also difficult to maintain. Since this method of managing student data is outdated, we propose a better way, i.e., using a computer software which can automate most of the work in maintaining such records.
